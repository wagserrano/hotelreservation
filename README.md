Please, consider the Azure SLA:

- SLA for App Service - Between 95% to 99.95% - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/app-service/v1_5/
- SLA for Azure Container Apps - Between 95% to 99.95% - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/container-apps/v1_0/
- SLA for Azure SQL Database - Between 95% to 99.995% - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/azure-sql-database/v1_8/
- SLA for Azure SQL Managed Instance - Between 95% to 99.95% - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/azure-sql-sql-managed-instance/v1_0/
